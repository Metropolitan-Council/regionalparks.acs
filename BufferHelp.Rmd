### Buffer distance

-----

Buffer distances (in miles) extend from the perimeter of park or trail units. For trails, the buffer distance is effectively a radius. For example, a one-mile buffer on each side of a trail would mean a two-mile diameter path centered on the trail. <br><br>

```{r include=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)

park <- regionalparks.acs::park_trail_geog_LONG[c(15),0] %>%
  st_transform(3857)
buf025 <- park  %>%
  st_buffer(dist = 1609.34 * .25)
buf05 <- park  %>%
  st_buffer(dist = 1609.34 * .5)

trail <- regionalparks.acs::park_trail_geog_LONG[c(109),0] %>%
  st_transform(3857)
tbuf025 <- trail  %>%
  st_buffer(dist = 1609.34 * .25)
tbuf05 <- trail  %>%
  st_buffer(dist = 1609.34 * .5)
```

Example of two different buffer distances (dark grey, light grey) around a park polygon (green):

```{r parkbuffer, include=F, echo=F, fig.width=2, fig.height=2}
parkbuffer = ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = buf05, fill = "grey90") +
  geom_sf(data = buf025, fill = "grey70") +
  geom_sf(data = park, fill = "#78A22F") +
  theme_void()
# parkbuffer
```
