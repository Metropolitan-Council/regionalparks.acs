### Data sources

-----

**Population characteristic** data is from the U.S. Census Bureau
(<a href ="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs" target = "_blank">American
Community Survey, 2015-2019</a>) and shows the highest spatial
resolution possible by variable (either Census tract or block group, see
‘Notes’). Each demographic characteristic is shown as a percentage of
the total population, with the exception of median household income,
which is displayed in dollars. The darker the color, the higher the
percentage (or income in dollars)." <br>

**Population estimates** are published by the Metropolitan Council.
Current population estimates are available for Census block groups.
Long-range forecasts are based on 2010 Census data and city
comprehensive plans and available at the transportation analysis zone (a
coarser spatial resolution than Census block groups). Forecasts of
shifting population demographics (race/ethnicity and age) are only
available at the regional level, and are summarised in a
