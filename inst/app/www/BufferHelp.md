### Buffer distance

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Buffer distances (in miles) extend from the perimeter of park or trail
units. For trails, the buffer distance is effectively a radius. For
example, a one-mile buffer on each side of a trail would mean a two-mile
diameter path centered on the trail. <br><br>

a park polygon (green):
