### Buffer distance

-----

Buffer distances (in miles) extend from the perimeter of units. For
trails, the buffer distance is effectively a radius (i.e.Â a 1.0 mile
buffer on each side of a trail would mean a 2.0 mile diameter path
centered on the trail.) <br><br>

Example of two different buffer distances (dark grey, light grey) around
a park polygon (green):
