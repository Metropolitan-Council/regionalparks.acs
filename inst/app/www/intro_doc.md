need additional help using this tool or interpreting results, please
contact [Darcie

for assistance. Please click on the individual tabs on the top to start
using this tool. We suggest you use a desktop web browser for the best
experience.

## What this tool does

This interactive provides data—primarily census and Council data—on the
characteristics of housing and residents near parks and trails in the
Twin Cities’ regional system. It provides a snapshot of who lives there
today, and the population changes forecasted to 2040.

## What this tool *cannot* do

Users can create valuable, data-driven analysis through this app. But
our experience tells us that demographic and housing data are most
powerful when used as starting point. In other words, the census and
Council data cannot substitute for engagement with prioritized
stakeholders. The on-the-ground knowledge of agency staff and the
community expertise of residents are also valued sources of information
and enhance and refine the shared understanding of this data.

## Who can use it?

We developed this interactive tool primarily for regional park agency
planning, outreach, programming, research and other agency staff. It is
available for anyone who wants detailed information about housing and
demographic data surrounding the existing and future regional park
system.

## How you can use it

  - **Planning**. Understanding today’s proximate demographics can help
    inform questions about needed amenities like multilingual signage.
    Visualizing forecasted changes in population can help plan for the
    future. Further, this tool can help complete the Council’s Equity
    Analysis Requirement for park and trail master plans
    (<a href="https://metrocouncil.org/Parks/Planning/Parks-Equity-Toolkit.aspx" target="_blank">Question
    1 *Project Data*</a>).

  - **Outreach and Engagement**. Learning more about who lives near
    parks and trails can guide strategies for community partnerships,
    communications efforts, and equity investments such as translation
    or transportation.

  - **Programming**. Learning more about who lives near parks and trails
    can deepen your understanding of bilingual, multigenerational, and
    other programming innovations that might be of interest to who lives
    close by.

  - **Research**. Use the data to better understand demographic gaps in
    potential versus actual visitors. We can use the data to ask
    questions about the inclusivity of current research practices
    relative to surrounding demographics. The data can be downloaded for
    additional analyses, but are subject to change with regular data
    releases (see “notes” tab).

## Why we built it

*Thrive MSP 2040* directs the Council to collaborate with the
Metropolitan Parks and Open Space Commission, regional park implementing
agencies, and state partners to strengthen equitable use of regional
parks and trails. Read more about this in the
