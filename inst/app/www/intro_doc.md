## Introduction

*Thrive MSP 2040* directs the Council to collaborate with the
Metropolitan Parks and Open Space Commission, regional park implementing
agencies, and state partners to strengthen equitable use of regional
parks and trails.

The Regional Parks and Trails Equity tool aims to provide all
stakeholders with a shared foundation of data and understanding about
the characteristics of residents and households living near parks and
trails today, and what population shifts are expected in the future with
the goal of enhancing both engagement and planning efforts to achieve
Thriveâ€™s directive.
<!-- The app complements the [Regional Parks Equity Toolkit](https://metrocouncil.org/parks/Planning/Parks-Equity-Toolkit.aspx), a set of questions and a process to clarify how regional park projects are advancing equity. Other stakeholders are invited to use this app in service of strengthening equitable use through understanding populations and their proximities to the regional park system. -->
