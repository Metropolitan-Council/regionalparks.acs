## Introduction

*Thrive MSP 2040* directs the Council to collaborate with the Metropolitan Parks and Open Space Commission, regional park implementing agencies, and state partners to strengthen equitable use of regional parks and trails.


Accordingly, the Council implemented an equity analysis requirement for all park and trail master plans. Master plans are required to identify the demographics of areas served by the proposed park or trail with a focus on underserved populations on the basis of age, race, ethnicity, income, ability, national origin, and other pertinent characteristics (see the "Variable Dictionary" within the "Notes" tab for more).


The app complements the [Regional Parks Equity Toolkit](https://metrocouncil.org/parks/Planning/Parks-Equity-Toolkit.aspx), a set of questions and a process to clarify how regional park projects are advancing equity. Other stakeholders are invited to use this app in service of strengthening equitable use through understanding populations and their proximities to the regional park system.


## User Guide

**Map** - is an interactive tool that maps key demographic variables alongside regional parks and trails.
        
**Summary** - is a data visualization that produces discrete demographic characteristics for user-defined inputs across the regional park and trail system. The tool incorporates existing, planned, and search areas for parks and trails. Within this tab, there are **weighted averages** which will be suitable for most users, a **buffer map** which illustrates the buffer zones geospatially, and the option for users to **download tabular data**


**Population Growth** - is an interactive map which allows users to view estimated population growth through 2040 alongside regional parks and trails.

**Notes** - provides more information about the background of this tool.

<!-- ## ACS Variable Dictionary  -->

<!-- Statistics produced for American Community Survey and included in ACS tables are survey-based estimates and are subject to error. The errors derive from research design (including instrument bias, data frame, and sampling), the survey data collection (non-response bias and response errors), and processing by the Census Bureau (data coding, compilation processes, and case weighting), as well as statistical inference error and uncertainty (which are related to sample size and variance within the measured attributes).   -->
